	<xsd:complexType name="SignalIdentificationInformation">
		<xsd:annotation>
			<xsd:documentation>This defines the content structure for identiying various parameters
				pertaining to the business signal. "OriginalMessageIdentifier" captures the value of
				the transport message identifier for original message to which this business signal
				is being sent. If business message has an identifier, that can be captured by the
				"OriginalDocumentIdentifier" attribute. "OriginalMessageDateTime" is the time when
				the original message was sent. "ThisMessageDateTime" is the time when this signal
				message is being sent. The following optional elements are there to provide access
				to information that can be used by processing logic outside the business process
				engine. One example of this could be a monitoring application which can use this
				information to provide status of a collaboration. "FromPartyInfo" describes the
				party id that is sending the signal message. "ToPartyInfo" describes the party id
				that is being sent the signal message. The roles described below are based on the
				implicit relationship between the partner sending the signal message and the partner
				who sent the original message to which this particular signal is being sent. The
				role relationship between partner sending the business message and the partner
				receiving it is captured in the process definition (ebBP). "FromRole" captures the
				role being played by the party that is sending the signal message. "ToRole" captures
				the role played by the party that is being sent the signal message.
				"ProcessSpecificationInfo" type descibes the process information (ebBP) which
				defines the runtime collaborations for which this signal is being sent
				"CollaborationIdentifier" is the unique identifer that associates the signal with a
				particular collaboration. This could come from the business message itself or in
				case of ebXML MSH, could be the messaging level header "ConversationId"
				"BusinessActivityIdentifier" identifies the business Requesting or Responding
				activity to which this signal is being sent. This would identify the
				"BusinessAction" from the process definition (ebBP) and could be implemented using
				the "name" attribute on either the RequestingBusinessActivity or the
				RespondingBusinessActivity.</xsd:documentation>

		<xsd:annotation>
			<xsd:documentation> This defines the content structure for messages that need to send an
				exception signals as a business signal message to a trading partner. For description
				of first nine elements, refer to documentation on SignalIdentificationInformation.
				"ExceptionType" is used to identify various exceptions that can occur during the
				execution of a Business Collaboration. Run time processing engine using ebBP based
				collaborations generates a "ReceiptException" if request message results in a
				negative Receipt Acknowledgement. This exception could be due to various problems
				like "Syntax validation" of business message", "Unauthorized execution of process",
				"Failure of Signature validation in incoming message", "Out of sequence message"
				corresponding respectively to "Syntax", "Authorization", "Signature", "Sequence".
				Run time processing engine using ebBP based collaborations generates a
				"AcceptanceException" if request message results in a negative Acceptance
				Acknowledgement. Please refer the technical specification for various reasons why
				negative Acceptance Acknowledgement may be sent. Run time processing engine using
				ebBP based collaborations can send a "GeneralException" if processing of a request
				message results in a catastrophic state where further processing can not continue.
				"Reason" can be used to send a message to convey the reason for exception being
				generated. "ExceptionMessage" can include a descriptive message corresponding to the
				exception </xsd:documentation>

			<xsd:documentation> This defines the content structure for messages that need to send an
				ReceiptAcknowledgement signals as a business signal message to a trading partner.
				Please refer to the ebBP technical specification for detailed description of
				ReceiptAcknowledgement. This element is used for conforming to
				NonRepudiationofReceipt(NRR) by including the "NonRepudiationInformation" child
				element as described below. For NonRepudiationofOrigin the originating business
				message will have nonrepudiation information. Signals are outside of this
				requirement. For description of first nine elements, refer to documentation on
				SignalIdentificationInformation. ReceiptAcknowledgement signals can include
				non-repudiation information if requested in the process definition.
				"NonRepudiationInformation" captures this data for each of the message parts that
				comprise the request message that was sent. Each "MessagePartNRInformation"
				describes non-repudiation information for a message part identified by
				"MessagePartIdentifier" using "Reference" described by XML Digital Signature
				Specification. Each part of the request message will have a corresponding
				"MessagePartNRInformation". If necessary, digital signature can be computed for this
				signal message and included using "Signature" element from XML Digital Signature
				namespace. </xsd:documentation>
