   * @param sMessageID
   *        The AS4 message ID. May not be <code>null</code>.
   * @param sURL
   *        The destination URL to which the transmission fails. May not be <code>null</code>.
   * @param nTry
   *        The current try that will be retried later, 0-based.
   * @param nMaxTries
   *        The maximum number of tries that will happen. 1-based. So e.g. 2 means that there will
   *        be 1 retry: one original try and one retry. If the number is e.g. 11: one original try
   *        and 10 retries.
   * @param nRetryIntervalMS
   *        The milliseconds to be waited before the next retry.
   * @param ex
   *        The exception that occurred during sending. Usually an IOException. Never
   *        <code>null</code>.
   * @return {@link EContinue#CONTINUE} to continue with the procedure as foreseen,
   *         {@link EContinue#BREAK} to interrupt resending. May not be <code>null</code>.
